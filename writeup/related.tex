%You should find existing papers, group them into categories based on their approaches, and talk about them: Discuss strengths and weaknesses. In your opinion, which approaches were clever/good? What is the state-of-the-art? Do most people perform the task by hand?
%
%You should have at least 15 references in the related work. Include previous attempts by others at your problem, previous technical methods, or previous learning algorithms. Google Scholar is very useful for this: https://scholar.google.com/ (you can click “cite” and it generates MLA, APA, BibTeX, etc.) You can also try http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/ to search for recent arXiv papers. Try to cite academic publications only (i.e., try to avoid citing blog posts or news articles). Note: arXiv citations are acceptable.

Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have been shown to be very useful for visual recognition tasks. AlexNet~\cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet} won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge~\cite{russakovsky2015imagenet} in 2012, spurring a lot of interest in using deep learning to solve challenging problems. Since then, deep learning has been used successfully in multiple fields like machine vision, facial recognition, voice recognition, natural language processing etc.

There are several flavors of image classification tasks that have been been proposed over the years. These range from being able to recognize hadwritten digits~\cite{lecun1990handwritten} to classifying plants using the images of leaves~\cite{kaggleleaf}.   

Our problem of classifying food dishes is unique. We did not find any existing work focussed on classifying food dishes from images. The closest example of a food-related task we could find was a \textit{restaurant classification} problem from Yelp~\cite{kagglerestaurantyelp}. In their scenario, they want to classify the images of \textit{restaurants} along some business attributes (e.g restaurant is kid friendly, has table service  etc). Classifying food dishes from images presents several distinct characteristics that we discuss in Sections~\ref{sec:datasetandfeatures} and~\ref{sec:evaluationresults}
