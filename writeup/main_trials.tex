%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   %The ABSTRACT is to be in fully-justified italicized text, at the top
   %of the left-hand column, below the author and affiliation
   %information. Use the word ``Abstract'' as the title, in 12-point
   %Times, boldface type, centered relative to the column, initially
   %capitalized. The abstract is to be in 10-point, single-spaced type.
   %Leave two blank lines after the Abstract, then begin the main text.
   %Look at previous CVPR abstracts to get a feel for style and length.
	
	We consider the problem of classifying food dishes. Food items have unique characteristics - they come in different colors and shapes, can be clustered into groups (e.g. fruits, vegetables), and can be combined in several ways to prepare a meal etc. This makes images of food dishes particularly interesting to classify. We show that convolutional neural networks are quite suitable for this task, and outperform traditional machine learning approaches in classifying food dishes.
